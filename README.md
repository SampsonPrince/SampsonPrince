## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

    As of Fall 2024 I'm currently finishing my Network Engineering & Cybersecurity degree. 

    I have experience with many languages at varied levels, here are most of them!
    - Bash
    - Powershell
    - Python
    - C#
    - HTML/CSS
    - JS
    - SQL

    Self-learning is the skil I consider the most valuable to myself, and I'm always ready to learn new things if there's a good cause for it.
